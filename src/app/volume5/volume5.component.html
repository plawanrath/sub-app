                The fifth volume of Shri Guru Bhagavat talks extensively about Faith and Blind Faith in the modern context. What is the cause of blind faith? The Guru Bhagavat goes on to explain that, fear gives rise to blind faith. From the verse 20 and 21 of Shri Guru Bhagavat, I quote, “If mind is like a house, then blind faith is like a flimsy cobweb within. Blind faith cloaks the consciousness just like the layers of dust that settle on the surface. Blind faith uses the person, who is scared in life, as its playground. Such a person desists from listening to anything against blind faith out of fear”. This form of fear mongering also gives rise to miracle mongering where in people may tend to believe that someone will magically just wave a wand and their sorrows will be gone; and this gives rise to blind faith.  To put it in other words, blind faith is associated to fear and advocated by belief in miracles. The true nature of devotion to a Guru should not be based on miracles but should be based on attraction to his qualities. A true devotee of a Guru is attracted to him because of his qualities. I quote from the verse 57 and 58 of the fifth volume of Shri Guru Bhagavat, “Faith reasons out truth through evidence. Blind faith is obscure and does not provide any underlying proof”.

                Let’s take the example of Shirdi Sai Baba. Over the years, millions and millions of people have visited the shrine of Shirdi coming from all parts of the world, belonging to different religions and beliefs. Why is that? Is that because of some miracles? No. It is inconceivable that so many people will follow someone because of miracles. The reason why so many people are attracted to him is because of his qualities. Because when they read the Sai Satcharitra or they see movies based on him or read books about his life, they can see that he was someone, who at that time in the early 1900s cut down the barriers of cast, religion, sect, language, etc. His greatness was absolving everyone into one fold. When he first came to Shirdi he was shunned by all but a few but eventually he ended up becoming a leader of his community, not because of miracles but because of his service to humanity. That is what makes him a great saint. That is the reason why so many people come to Shirdi each day.

                Sure, there will always be some people who will try to encourage fraud in the name of god or saints. But one should always remember that encouraging fraud in the name of a Guru is a sin. The Guru Bhagavat says on verse 42 of volume 5, “It is immaterial whether a belief in blind faith is significant or paltry because prejudice emanates from blind faith”.

              The activities of cursing and blessing are tricky to understand. There are many theories to it but best way to look at them is to think of blessings as positive energy and curses as negative energy. So one could go with this analogy and understand that to be able to give out positive energy or blessing one must have sufficient positive energy in him; where as when someone curses another, that person creates negative energy.  The Book V of Shri  Guru Bhagavat talks in detail about the concept of Cursing and Blessing. From verses 8 and 9 of the chapter "The Act of Cursing and Blessing" I quote, "Curses and blessings are special acts which can be brought to bear in society. Inflicting a curse is an evil act and bestowing a blessing is a noble act. By their innate nature, curses and blessings are inverse activities".

              This explanation of  cursing and blessing goes on to show how blessings can be conferred. It says that blessings can be given not only by speech but by means of physical contact or glances. It can also be bestowed through the medium of thought waves. It also goes on to explain that the blessings of Saints always come to fruition because they have immense amount of positive energy in them. The same chapter also goes on to explain that sometimes, what may seem like a curse actually turns out to be a blessing. It goes on to explain that when one curses someone else they waste punya (positive energy) and accumulate papa(negative energy).  So by this logic, it is obvious that when someone curses another, regardless of whether the curse bares fruit or not, the person who gave the curse accumulates negative energy because of his act of cursing.

              From the verse 49 and 50 of the same chapter of volume V of Shri Guru Bhagavat I quote, "Some people inflict a curse without any valid reason. Curses bear results, only if their exists a justifiable reason, otherwise they reboundto the person inflicting the curse".

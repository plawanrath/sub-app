And to accomplish that purpose of Sai-sentiment, Guruji Chandrabhanu Satpathy’s diligent work in this path is praiseworthy.

                Overcoming the greatest hurdles in life is a reflection of the human pursuit. One needs to invoke the inner powers to face the situation, no matter how intolerable it is. Guru’s kindness ushered on the disciple is the only way to realize such power. Only the Sadguru can construct the gracious life of a disciple by generating pure divine emotions in him. Through divine emotions, The Guru gets rid of the desires in the disciple, thus giving him the ability to face the torments of the mundane life. The assurance in this regard has been given by the author as follows:

              When we talk about life, there is always the hidden fear of death looming in the background. We pray each day in some form or the other and ask god for worldly goals and things; we beg him to make our lives a little better than what it currently is, no matter how successful we are in our lives. We pray for prosperity, we pray for happiness, we ask him more money, better clothes, more food, every and anything but we fear death which we know takes us closer to him who we pray to. What an oxymoron! As the Guru Bhagavat puts it and I quote, “At the time of death, a human being gets extremely worried. As fear of death dawns, he becomes mighty scared. All his intelligence and cunningness fails and he prays the Almighty to save him from death.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Why are we so scared of death? I know personally, why I am scared of dying. I feel if I die now, what happens to everyone who depend on me? I fear if I die now, there are so many things in this world that I want to do, so many places that I want to see, I won’t be able to do any of those things and be gone from the world. That thought scares me the most about death. Reading the section on death in the Guru Bhagavat, the solution I discovered to my worries about my death was that unless we let go of worldly attachments and focus on our Guru or god, we will only be trapped in the circle of illusions which is life. As I see it, this doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have goals in life. It only means we shouldn’t let our worldly goals and ambitions dictate our lives and by extension we shouldn’t let them dictate how we feel during the time of our death; instead we remember the Guru.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Guru Bhagavat describes in detail what happens in the human body during death. It also goes on in great detail explaining how the life force departs the body when time comes ending the cycle of life. It tells us that the soul doesn’t die with the body instead, it wonders around with a vain belief that it is still in the physical manifestation of the human body. Although, slowly but surely this belief fades away and the realization that death was what happened dawns the soul, then finally the worldly attachments fade away as well. The Guru Bhagavat explains that death is always painful and it goes on to say that, and I quote “One who continuously remembers the Sadguru at such time of death surely receives his kindness which reduces his death pang”.
            </p>

              The only certainty about life is death. It comes to all. But death need not be scary, instead it should be empowering and it can be if we have the memory of the Guru in our soul during our final hour in the human body. As the Guru Bhagavat puts it very concisely, at the time of death of a true devotee, the Sadguru appears before the soul with all his divine glory and while draining the life force, comforts him and allays his fears. How can an experience like this be anything but fulfilling!

              We humans are social beings. Our personalities are usually shaped based on whose company we surround ourselves with. No living being for that matter can live without company. Societies and Civilizations are created when people come together. But, amongst all of the various kinds of companionships, the one between the Guru and his devotees is the most rewarding. As the Guru Bhagavat puts it and I quote, “Only when God is compassionate, that one gains the company of the Guru”.

              The Shri Guru Bhagavat explains the relationship between Guru and disciple in great detail. It explains that, it is not just the devotee who looks for the Guru for guidance, but in fact when they unite, they both gain knowledge of their true self. “The Guru is God for his disciple. The Guru also looks at the disciple as a part of God”. From all this, it is quite evident that both Guru and the disciple seek each other out and when accepting a disciple Guru looks for existence of his noble qualities and if he finds traces of such qualities, then he accepts the disciple as his own.Guru is always aware of all the disciple’s sins and virtues, and his only mission is to redeem his disciple of worldly illusions. When someone is over-powered by his worldly agonies, he beseeches god mournfully to redeem him from his miseries; and when god becomes merciful, only then the disciple meets his Guru. But the manner in which a Guru meets his disciple is dependent upon the Guru’s discretion.

              A vivid example of Guru and disciple companionship is the relationship between Ramakrishna and Vivekananda, which began in November 1881 when they met at the house of Surendra Nath Mitra. Ramakrishna asked Vivekananda(or Narendranath as he was known then) to sing and then impressed by his singing, he invited Narendranath to Dakshineswar. It is very interesting to note that, Ramakrishna waited anxiously waited six months until Narendranath finally came to Dakshineswar to meet him. Such is the magnanimity of this relationship that the Guru equally yearns to meet the disciple. It is also noteworthy that the first meeting at Dakshineswar had puzzled young Narendranath and he was skeptical about Ramakrishna although eventually he accepted Ramakrishna as his Guru and went on to establish Ramakrishna Math, and gave lectures in New York and England in 1901 on Ramakrishna which were later compiled into a book “My Master”.

              This is a perfect example of the purity of relationship between the Guru and disciple. This example also reemphasized another excerpt from the Shri Guru Bhagavat, and I quote “One who always remembers the Guru,(slowly) transforms to his form and gets infused with the (divine) qualities of the Guru.”

              Guru is a free soul and every act of Guru is for the greater good. For a Guru, the devotees become his responsibility and Guru tries to guide them towards the correct path for their spiritual enlightenment. To achieve this, a Guru sometimes does things or says things that to his devotees are perceived as miracles. The Guru because he has been through a lot of spiritual practice, he has grasp over the powers of nature and is aware of the past, present and future. It is because of this knowledge and powers that Guru can do things like spontaneously reading minds, curing incurable diseases, etc which are miracles to the ignorant.

              As an example, consider the life of Shri Shirdi Sai. As per the Sai Satcharitra, Sai Baba entered the state of Samadhi and came back from it at will, he changed the taste of Neem leaves, he lit lamps with water, and numerous other activities which were all miraculous to everyone around him but more importantly they were all towards a larger humanitarian purpose. Throughout his lifetime and even after he always taught the values of Belief and Patience. As it is pointed out in Shri Guru Bhagabata Volume 2 in the section for “The Power Of Miracles Of The Guru” and I quote, “Shri Guru is a free soul and such freedom is (purely) divine and not otherwise. Every act of the Guru is sacrosanct and is for the good of others.” It also says in the verse 7 and 8 of the same section and I quote, “The Guru is the embodied form of God possessing such (divine) capabilities”. Like in the stories of Shri Sai there have been instances where he has given darshan in the form of Shri Ram, Vithoda, etc.

              The same section of Guru Bhagabata beautifully explains further that the Guru because of his vast knowledge and his control over the elements of nature relates to human beings as the human beings and other animals accordingly and all the thoughts and wishes of the devotees are known to him. The Guru uses this knowledge and his powers for the good of the entire eco system. This is the purpose of the Guru’s miracles.

              God created the universe as we know it. As put in the Volume 2 of Shri Guru Bhagavat and I quote, “The universe was created out of twenty-five percent of his total power. The residual seventy-five percent yet remains in the non-manifested form”. So, this shows the magnanimity of the all mighty who only needed one fourth of his powers to create the universe. That begs the question, what about the rest three-fourth ? Well, in the same section of Shri Guru Bhagavat, it goes on to say and I quote, “the residual seventy-five percent of powers of God remains in a dormant(latent) state”. This residual power is called Sheshanath as per the Hindu mythology which roughly translates to residual God. This has been depicted in Hindu mythologyy as Shri Vishnu sleeping on the ocean of milk on a coiled snake which metaphorically means that God(Shri Vishnu) is resting on his non-manifested power(the snake).  So Shri Guru Bhagavat draws on this view to explain that, if we consider Shri Guru to be the entire creation or the one-fourth of the powers, then the disciple is the latent form or the residual three-fourth percent of the powers. So one completes the other and together they become the entire manifestation of God.

              This whole perception of the Guru and its disciple shows the importance of both the Guru and his disciples in each other’s existence. Which means that one cannot exist without the other. The disciple is as important to the Guru as is the Guru to the disciple. The Guru is the one forth of the power which is ever present and equivalent of the manifested form of God where as the disciple is the dormant and ignorant three forth of the power. This is significant because it shows that to truly love and respect God, means to respect both his sides or in other words to respect both the Guru and his disciple.

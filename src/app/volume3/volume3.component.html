              Volume Three deals with Dharma (path of righteousness), knowledge of Death (Mirtyu Vidya), Karma Phal (Action Reaction syndrome of Hindu spiritual science), Spiritual practices relating to the Guru ( Guru Sadhana). Mirtyu Vidya– “The Science of Death” has been a hallmark of this volume which has drawn an inquisitive mind to seek answer for how  and what happens at the time of “death of a soul”. The main aspects of Mrityu-Vidya deals with- the role of Sadguru at the time of death of devotee. Remarkable features of this volume is the mention of journey of soul after death into Heaven (Swarga-Loka) and Hell (Narka- Loka). The theory of Karma- Phala (action reaction syndrome of Hindu spiritual science) is also another prominent feature of this volume wherein the author has mentioned various aspects of seed of Karma. The author has also revealed on how Karmic debt results and how the shackles of debts (Rinanubandha) manifested as per Karma is pretty much eye opening for the readers to realize in this volume. Another notable feature of this volume is – Guru Sadhana (Meditation on Guru) deals with different types of meditation, mental worship, worship of Guru and seven levels of Sadhana (Meditation).

                “All human activities are born out of human desire. The fulfillment or non-fulfillment of one’s desire, at times generates another desire. Similarly, one activity leads to other activities in life” - Shri Guru Bhagavat Volume III.  
              </p>
              <p>
                The premise of the above sentences is basically this; we human beings have worldly desires and these worldly desires prompt us to action. Our actions are decided based on what we want to achieve. Now, whether we achieve our goal or not, that in turn generates another desire another goal, and then we act to try and fulfill that. This goes on in an endless cycle. Now another factor to consider about actions, is that every action that we perform has some consequence good or bad.
              </p>
              <p>
                This whole theory shows the complexity of Karma. Let’s consider this for a moment that there is a single desire which leads to some actions for the fulfillment of that desire, and each of these actions will have some lateral consequences which may have their own impact and then again whether our actions led to success or failure in our desire, that again leads to another desire which leads to its own set of actions, and so on. This cobweb of desires and actions is Maya. Moreover, it is entirely possible that when performing a noble act, one might inadvertently commit a sin. The tricky part about its complexity is that, when we do an action, there is no way for us to know whether that action will entangle us in the web of Maya and this is where the Guru solves the conundrum of the devotee.                
              </p>
              <p>
                Now karma creates karmic debts. So when we perform a karma a debt is created which must be paid. So karma creates a debt and in the process of payment of that old debt a new karmic debt is created and the cycle goes on and a person does not get salvation until all debts are paid. Now simple math shows that if at some point Karmas that we perform do not generate any karmic debts and break the cycle only then, we can pay out our karmic debts and get salvation. The solution to this conundrum is provided in Shir Guru Bhagavat Volume 3, and I quote from verses 20 and 21 “However, if he does not yearn for the benefits of his karma, then fresh Rina (karmic debt) does not get created. Further, if a devotee offers the results of his karma to the Sadguru, even then karmic debts do not get created.”                
              </p>   
              <p>
                So, by not yearning the benefits of ones Karma and by offering the results of ones karma to the Sadguru one can make sure that karmic debts do not get created and keeping this up while paying previous karmic debts, one can finally gain salvation.

              The Shri Guru Bhagavat Volume III talks extensively about meditation on the Guru. The Guru Bhagavat explains the two forms of meditation which are the meditation of the form and the meditation of the formless. The meditation of the form is the easier of the two where the devotee needs to the concentrate on the physical form of the Guru and meditate while the formless meditation is much tougher to achieve. But the devotees who achieve the formless meditation of the Guru they come to realize the magnanimity of the powers of their Guru. It is written in the Bhagvad Gita too and I quote, “When meditation is mastered, the mind is unwavering like the flames of a candle in a windless place.”              
            </p>
            <p>
              When the devotee intently focuses on the complete form of the Guru, he begins to understand the divine qualities of the Guru and as he maintains the concentration and meditation of the form of the Guru, he slowly transcends into the realm of the formless state of meditation. The different planes of spiritual journey achieved through meditation are explained in great detail in the volume III of the Shri Guru Bhagavat. It further goes on to explain that when devotees come to a Guru for their spiritual journey, the Guru creates obstacles for his devotees to increase patience and resilience in them. The Guru knows the personality of his devotees, so naturally the Guru knows the worldly desires that the devotee has. The Guru also knows the amount of hate, anger, ego and other negative qualities that the devotee might have. So these obstacles created by the Guru, are nothing but a means to rid the devotee of all the negativity filled inside of him for unless the negativity is shed there wouldn’t be room for positive energy of meditation to come in.  Once the Guru sees that the devotee is free of the negativity, he then takes the devotee through happiness and sorrow in the path of spiritual evolution.              
            </p>
            <p>
              Through the path of this spiritual journey, the Guru helps clarify any doubts that the devotee might have either directly or indirectly. Meditation on Guru demands complete faith in the Guru. A true devotee has to always strive to comply by any and all instructions of his Guru and in return the Guru bestows his companion on the devotee. The Guru not only eradicates the negative qualities, but also helps elevate the noble qualities of his devotee. When the devotee’s negativity is taken away and his noble qualities are elevated the devotee through the Guru’s direct or indirect assistance starts performing noble deeds. Through this whole journey, the devotee realizes that the Guru is actually the divine.​As it is put in the Volume III of Shri Guru Bhagavat, and I quote, “When in the state of spiritual ecstasy, a devotee feels as if the Guru is nothing but God himself and is the divine animator of the universe. Such an emotional upsurge creates spiritual pulsation in his heart. The devotee feels as if the Guru is nothing but a universal divine consciousness. Although he is in a physical form, he truly pervades the universe in a celestial form.”

              I offer my prayers to The Divine Power- The Guru, The Perfect Master,
              who guides us in releasing our Soul from all bondages. The soul is bounded
              by our past deeds or “Prarabdha karma” which is responsible for making this
              present physical body, mind and thought of each individual. That prarabdha
              karma makes a person a saint or a burglar, a rich man or a poor man, a
              philanthropist or a miser. But the blessings of the Perfect Master break this
              chain of bondage and releases the soul. The path of redemption is nothing
              but “The Knowledge of The Self”. This knowledge which hidden in the
              darkness of ignorance, is revealed by our Guru. Thus in the book
              ‘GuruGita’, it has been mentioned: “There is no element or austerity beyond The
              Perfect Master”.

              Many scriptures have written on the theory of Guru-Disciple relationship
              in the Indian culture. The Hindu philosophy has ranked this relationship at
              the top by demonstrating various examples. A disciple’s devotion towards
              his Guru and Guru’s generosity towards His disciple are like a sailor in a
              sail. Like the sailor, Guru gives His strength and power to His disciple to
              cross this ocean of bondages. He guides at each and every step of life to
              reduce the prarabdha karma and draws the disciple towards the Divine
              Power. At the same time, the disciple’s faith and patience towards his Guru
              helps him in getting that Ultimate Truth. And this bondage of love between
              the Guru and the disciple continues from one life to another.

              Here one question keeps coming to our mind that: What is this debt
              of ‘Prarabdha Karma’ and how does selfrealization help in repaying this debt? What
              is the form of that Power of Guru which helps us in realizing our-self? The answers
              to all of these questions, conflicts and doubts have been articulated in a very
              meaningful and comprehensive way in ‘Shri Guru Bhagavat, Vol-3”. This volume of Shri
              Guru Bhagavat inspires us to be patient, calm and tolerant in our day to day life. The
              author of this book Dr. Chandrabhanu Satpathy, has elaborately described the
              most important and difficult part of the theory of action (Karma tattwa). This book will help or guide us to walk in
              the right path by leaving behind our ego, pride, prejudice and power. This book is truly a source of inspiration for the entire humanity.

              Here the author has mentioned how His Guru, ‘The Perfect Master’ has
              released Him from this worldly illusion. This prarabdha karma defined in Shri
              Guru Bhagavat is acceptable and admirable from the intellectual point of
              view. The reader can take references from the book and apply in his or her
              day to day life. As mentioned, all the joys and sorrows in our relationships
              are the merely the reflection of our past deeds, which needs to be
              compensated only with the help of others. And because of that we take
              birth again and again until it comes to the neutral state.

              There are many theories narrated in ‘Karma yoga’ (yoga of action) of
              Bhagavad Gita based upon the law of action which is beyond our normal
              understanding. Shirdi Sai Baba, The Perfect Master had explained prarabdha
              karma using examples of the tiger, the wall lizard, the goat and many others
              which find mention in the book ‘Sai Satcharitra’ written by Hemadapanth in
              the year 1930. All those theories of karma-phala (effects of action) have been
              explained in detail in the third volume of ‘Shri Guru Bhagavat’ which are
              universal and eternal in nature. It has been composed in a way that can be
              comprehended by all. With the blessings of Shri Guru, this could well be universally accepted. Pertaining to this, author Dr. C.B. Satpathy has
              written: 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Karma khela ati gahana || Bujhibaa bahut kathina<br/>

              The main purpose of the epic composition Shri Guru Bhagavat is the
              welfare of mankind and the growth of human values in the society. Rather
              than any specific religion, beliefs and practices, it intends to help the
              spiritual development of the human beings and build a stronger, healthier
              society. It is very clear from the intellectual point of view that whoever
              reads this book, can feel the very presence of the Divine Power in every
              step of life. The soul reincarnates in human form just to undergo earthly
              suffering caused as a result of its past deeds, and the reactions of all the
              actions accumulated in the current life is passed on to the next. Between
              these points of birth and death, the debt of actions and sufferings never 
              cease, and the journey of life continues indefinitely in a cyclic order. The
              living being never realizes the Supreme Power which controls this journey.
              Being tired from numerous cycles of birth and death, the living being
              realizes that his existence is merely a minuscule spec in this huge universe.
              His origin and end are both from the same source, The Supreme Soul. Only
              Sadguru, The Perfect Master is the medium to receive the blessings of that
              Supreme Soul, and the living being takes refuge at His Lotus feet. This state
              is called the spiritual upliftment of the being. That is why we need to
              understand and practice this theory in our short lifespan. Even after
              understanding and leading the life in the righteous path, sometimes we fail
              to get freedom from the bondage of our work. The mind which is subtle
              and invisible, resides in our body and makes us debt ridden by creating so
              many desires for the body. The in-depth understanding of one’s mind will
              lead to salvation. This knowledge is called The Knowledge of The Self,
              Aatmagyaana, which we can get only through the blessings of our Guru, The
              Perfect Master.
